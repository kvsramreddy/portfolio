### About Me
Welcome to the Intersection of Data and Story Telling

üöÄ Hello! I'm Ram Kandula, a data voyager charting courses through unexplored realms of numbers and narratives. With a master's degree in Data Science and Analytics as my compass, I navigate the vast seas of SQL and NoSQL databases with a fondness for the unique routes offered by Graph Databases.

üìä My toolkit is rich ‚Äì from the structured queries of SQL to the statistical stories told by SAS, R, and Python. I've woven these threads into predictive models and algorithms that don't just solve problems; they reveal new perspectives in business landscapes.

üîç As a former Quality Assurance Analyst, I don‚Äôt just look for bugs; I seek opportunities to enhance quality at every turn. I thrive under pressure, meet deadlines with finesse, and believe that clear communication and collaboration are the winds that propel projects forward.

üåü In this portfolio, you'll witness a tapestry of projects where data doesn't just inform but inspires. Whether through machine learning models, data mining explorations, or insightful visualizations, each project is a step in my journey to turn data into decisions, questions into answers, and challenges into triumphs.

‚ú® Let's embark on this journey of discovery and data together!

## Project in progress for STA 631
Project Proposal: Trend Analysis and Price Forecasting of Petroleum pricing and consumption data Data

Objective: This project aims to conduct a comprehensive trend analysis and forecast future retail prices of petroleum commodities using historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The focus will be on identifying significant trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in energy prices over the past decades and predicting future prices using statistical modeling techniques.

Data Source: Data will be sourced from the EIA, utilizing their API to access historical prices and petroleum consumption.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Use Python scripts to extract historical price data from the EIA API.
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and prepare the data, handling missing values and outliers and ensuring consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand historical trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations between consumption and pricing.
Trend Analysis: Utilize time-series analysis to identify and visualize long-term trends and patterns in energy prices.
Price Forecasting: Implement statistical models such as ARIMA or SARIMA to forecast future prices, considering seasonality and historical trends.
Model Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics, such as MAE, RMSE, or MAPE, to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models.

Expected Outcomes:
Detailed insights into the price trends of various energy commodities.
Reliable forecasts of future prices aid in decision-making for stakeholders in the energy sector.
A comprehensive report documenting the analysis's findings, methodology, and implications.
